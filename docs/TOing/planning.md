# Venue Space & Planning

Venue space and resource allocation is also a major item to consider for tournaments.  You want to allow people to be able to move and sit properly.  As such you need to consider what and where games are being played.  An example would be segregating games so it’s easier to manage or how much space an event would need (e.g. doubles needing space for 4 people, RR pools needs standing room to swap players).  Wire management needs to be also noted to prevent messes with the potential of pulling a whole line of setups down.

So what would good flow and space look like?  

Always have easy enter and exit routes.  Keep that space as clean as possible so people don’t need to jump over stuff or walk past setups.

Don’t bottleneck setups in the middle of table rows if the room is setup in rows; no one should jump over tables to get to their setup.  

Have setups dedicated to doubles, i.e. room for 4 people comfortably.

Room for pools, i.e. standing room for players

* Having 4 setups on each corner of a table is a good setup and is used for many tournaments.  Two corners can be used for doubles, the other 2 for singles.

Registration is away from the setups to prevent congestion within the venue and should the first thing people to be able to reach

* I have registration in the hallway beside the CS room for reference, the hallway is long and the entry into the two rooms aren’t blocked

Space for the streaming setup.  I always allocate a huge blocked off section for the stream.  The equipment is fragile and no one should ever touch the setup without the streamer’s permission.  Bonus points if you can connect to the projector.  Remember to allow some space for spectators as the stream match is usually higher profile.
