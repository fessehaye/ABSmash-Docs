# Payouts

[[toc]]

## Intro 

These are just recommended payout spreads. You can adjust these examples to fit your needs but only if you know what you are doing. 
A good rule of thumb is that the lowest paided out placement should at least get their money back.

Example:
* Doing top 6 payout for a singles bracket
* $5 dollar entry
* 5th place should at least get $5

::: tip
If you are TOing, this should be done and ready before your bracket hits top 8 so people don't have to wait for their money.
:::

Remember that you might have to account for not having exact change for these payouts if you are doing this the day of the event. 
You will probably have to round up/down the final amounts to make it easier to distribute.

It is recommended that you have a cashbox to keep the money safe and to use envelopes to distribute payouts for larger events.

This system works for both singles and doubles/crews. 

::: warning
Remember that one team/crew is one entrant to keep things simple.
