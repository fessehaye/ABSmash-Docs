# Payouts

[[toc]]

## Intro 

These are just recommended payout spreads. You can adjust these examples to fit your needs but only if you know what you are doing. 
A good rule of thumb is that the lowest paided out placement should at least get their money back.

Example:
* Doing top 6 payout for a singles bracket
* $5 dollar entry
* 5th place should at least get $5


It is recommended that you have a cashbox to keep the money safe and to use envelopes to distribute payouts for larger events.

This system works for both singles and doubles/crews. 

::: warning
Remember that one team/crew is one entrant to keep things simple.

## Delivery

So there are two ways to payout players:

1. Onsite Payout

The most common choice especially for locals and smaller events. Remember that you might have to account for not having exact change for these payouts if you are doing this the day of the event. You will probably have to round up/down the final amounts to make it easier to distribute. Remember to have a writing tool and envelopes to seperate the money for each places. 

::: tip
If you are TOing, this should be done and ready before your bracket hits top 8 so people don't have to wait for their money.
:::

2. Payment After Event

The option you might choose if you have the following situations:

* Did online registration through smash.gg (Using Paypal or Stripe).
* Waiting for pot bonus money from external source.
* If you do a tournament in an enviornment that might label the event as gambling (example NAIT)

If this is the case, please pay attention to how much money is in the pot and plan ahead to how to split the total. Make sure that you exchange contact information with any of the top 8 players per event because not everyone has a facebook account or is on your friend list. Make sure you have or have someone with experience with [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/ca/home) or [Etransfer](http://interac.ca/en/interac-e-transfer-consumer.html).

::: warning
If the player is not from Canada, they are not likely familar with Etransfer and it is best to deal with the whole situation with Paypal.

## Pot Bonus

Sometimes if you are collaborating with another organization or if you are under-budget for your event you will have the opportunity to add a pot bonus for specific tournament events.
 
A pot bonus is just a fixed amount of money that you add to the existing pot of an individual event. Usually applied to singles (1v1) events. I personally treat a pot bonus like I am adding X amount of players to the bracket when applying payouts.

The pot bonus must be applied to the payouts before you pay players out. You can use the payout calculator below if you need help figuring out exact amounts.

::: tip
Pot Bonuses are not a substitute of making your event higher quality. A pot bonus only affects a small percentage of your entrants. There are many solutions to give all participants a better experience and you are responsible for experimenting.

Example:

1. Melee Singles has 30 entrants at a 10$ event. (300$ Pot Total)
2. My Fake Sponsor has given me a $200 pot bonus to add to melee singles. (equiv of 20 people being added to the bracket).
3. The pot is now $500 and I have the option to pay out top 8 instead top 6. (Look at payout charts)
