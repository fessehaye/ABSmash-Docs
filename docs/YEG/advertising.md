# How to Advertise

[[toc]]

## Intro

Advertising could affect the attendance of your event depending on the scale of your event. Experimenting with advertising is equally important toward the overall quality of the tournament just as much as the actual bracket management.

If you are success with it, you will obviously attract more people at the event, which means you will get more venue fee. Having more venue fee means you have a larger budget to make a better event or directly treat players/volunteers.

Here are some suggestions for advertising smash events.

## Goals

## Do it early

## Have art assets ready before you announce the event

## Hire someone to do your branding

## Use the following social media platforms

## Invite neighbouring regions

## Advertise to your collage/school

## Do not immediately show attendance list from smash.gg

## Make your smash.gg page look nice

## Don't forget to make a facebook event page

## Do early bird pricing for venue fee

## Create incentives for people attending from out of city

## Create incentives for people to register early

## Flying out players

## Remind people to register one on one
