# Players Ban

These are players that as a community we decided to ban for misconduct. You are not forced to follow this list but it is strongly recommended unless you are involved with your own independent event. If a player is banned they are not allowed to enter tournaments or play friendlies. If the venue is rented out, the player is also not allowed to enter the parameter.
